**HackerRank named Diagonal_difference**
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.<br/>

For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:<br/>
1 2 3<br/>
4 5 6<br/>
9 8 9 <br/>

the left-to-right diagonal is 1 + 5 + 9 = 15 <br/>
the right to left diagonal is 3 + 5 + 9 = 17 <br/>
Their absolute difference is [15 - 17] = 2<br/>
